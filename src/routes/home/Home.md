### Mission Statement

Level Playing Field is a searchable database of consumer arbitration cases, [a forum](https://forum.levelplayingfield.io) and [a blog](https://blog.levelplayingfield.io). We were formed as a 501(c)(3) so [monetary donations](https://www.patreon.com/levelplayingfield) are charitable tax deductions.

Use [search](/search) to find specific [Parties](/search?q=is:party) (businesses, arbitrators, attorneys, etc.) or [Cases](/search?q=is:case). For example, type "Citibank" in the search box above and hit enter. Or search for a specific arbitrator by typing part of their name and hitting enter. For more examples, visit our [search help page.](/search-help).

You can also click "Cases" in the top right to browse and sort.
