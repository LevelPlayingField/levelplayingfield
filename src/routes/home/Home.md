Level Playing Field is a searchable database of consumer arbitration cases. We
were formed as a 501(c)(3) so monetary donations are charitable tax deductions.

Use the [search](/search) to find specific parties or cases. Or click on "Cases" 
or "Parties" in top right to browse (sorting is forthcoming). For example, type 
"Citibank" in the search box above and hit enter. Or search for a specific 
arbitrator by typing part of their name.

We will continue to add useful features as well as summary data on parties and 
arbitration overall. e.g., allowing parties to a case to share more information
about their case: what was claimed, the outcome, feedback on the arbitrator, etc.

To help us work on this full-time and incorporate cool features, please [donate](https://lpf.dntly.com/#/donate).
