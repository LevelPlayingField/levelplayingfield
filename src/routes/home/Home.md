# Mission Statement

Level Playing Field is a searchable database of consumer arbitration cases. We
were formed as a 501(c)(3) so monetary donations are charitable tax deductions.

Use the [search](/search) to find specific parties or cases, or to just browse. The next
steps are to provide summary data on each party and on arbitration overall as well as
allowing parties to a case to share more information about their case. e.g. what was
claimed, the outcome, feedback on the arbitrator, etc.

One of the biggest impediments to a fair arbitration process is the lack of
transparency.

We are doing this in our spare time as a community service. Our code base is open
source, you can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/levelplayingfield/levelplayingfield).
To help us incorporate cool features, you can contribute some new code, or donate to
help fund our time.
