### About Us

Level Playing Field is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that educates the public on forced consumer and employee arbitration and related issues.

We leverage technology to empower individuals with disputes *today.* Not everyone can wait for the civil justice system to be made more fair *tomorrow.* We're fighting to put you on a more *level playing field* right now.

We began by publishing a freely-available, continuously-updated consumer and employee arbitration case database.  We also provide ongoing summary data analysis.  Reports, expert testimony and affidavits are available on request.

We encourage parties that have been through forced arbitration to share their stories [in our forums](https://forum.levelplayingfield.io) and by commenting on their cases (which tie back to the forums). If you think your case might be subject to confidentiality, [ask us.](mailto:team@lpf.io?subject=About+Us+Confidentiality) We've yet to see a non-neogtiated consumer agreement with a confidentiality clause. Employment and settlement agreements usually have one.

We also encourage those with experience in dispute resolution to contribute to the forums.

The more information parties share, the better off we all are.

We now [publish a blog](https://blog.levelplayingfield.io) where we highlight arbitration and related stories that we aren't seeing covered elsewhere.

Finally, as a 501(c)(3), your donations are fully tax-deductible - and fully-appreciated.  We have a [Patreon for recurring monthly donations](https://www.patreon.com/levelplayingfield) and a [Paypal for one-time donations.](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=J8KHLEX98Z38Y)

Even one dollar a month helps. We try to offer our supporters early access to data and analysis.

Level Playing Field is just getting started and we have plenty more big ideas to roll out as time and our budget allows.
