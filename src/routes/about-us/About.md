# About Us

We're problem solvers. Sometimes we find problems and other times they find us. This is a case of the latter.

The ultimate question we want to answer is: if consumer arbitration is fair, shouldn't the distribution of arbitration outcomes be comparable to that of the public court system?

The studies we've reviewed indicate otherwise, and significantly so.

So if we assume arbitrators are impartial (definitely not an answered question), why is the distribution of outcomes so lopsided in favor of businesses?

One theory is that the lack of transparency leads consumers to try cases that have already been tried unsuccessfully.  The obfuscation of process and outcomes prevents consumers from learning the lessons of prior cases while repeat businesses can easily share information.  This obfuscation is inherently unfair.

A way to help create transparency is to make a public database of arbitration cases and their outcomes - thereby allowing relatively frictionless information sharing.

That is Level Playing Field.

We're building and perfecting a public and easily accessible database of consumer arbitration cases. Once we are satisfied with this first iteration, we plan to add features that allow parties to share information about their case. e.g., "I sued Citibank over this and here are the relevant filings"; or, "this case is related to this court case"; or even further, for attorneys, "contact me if you're considering a similar case and I'll help you learn from our lessons."

The database allows you to answer such questions as: Does a particular arbitrator always side with the business?  Which arbitrators provide incomplete information?  What do the attorneys in a prior case have to say about the arbitrator?  etc.

This database is the first step. We have formed Level Playing Field as a 501(c)(3) and hope to raise enough money to add as many cool and useful features as possible and continue advocating for a fair process.

A transparent justice system is important.
