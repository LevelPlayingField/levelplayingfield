# About Us

We're problem solvers. Sometimes we find problems and other times they find us. This is a case of the latter.

Daniel read his Citibank arbitration agreement to see that he had a small claims court option. After trying to reach resolution directly for 18 months, he filed a small claims court claim. Despite their agreement, Citibank managed to find a loophole to force his small claims court claim into arbitration. Resolution that should've taken mere months at little-to-no-cost ended up taking over four-and-a-half years and hundreds of thousands of dollars. While Daniel won (Citibank has appealed), his journey exposed him to the many shortfalls in the consumer arbitration and legal systems. Shortfalls that unnecessarily prejudice the process against consumers.

Arbitration can and is used by non-consumer parties to drag out resolution and get more favorable outcomes. In small claims court, plaintiffs win 85-89% of the time. In regular court, plaintiffs win 55-60% of the time. In arbitration, plaintiffs win 30% of the time. Why is that? Shouldn't the outcomes be similar?

One theory is that the lack of transparency leads consumers to try cases that have already been tried and they are unlikely to win. Unlike a case in a public court, there isn't a detailed record of arbitration cases and outcomes.

Fortunately, several state legislatures have attempted to address this issue. Arbitration forums are required to publish quarterly "metadata" on their cases. This data is locked away in inconvenient and incomplete CSV files. Our mission is to change that and to provide some value add.

We're building and perfecting a public and easily accessible database of consumer arbitration cases. Once we are satisfied with this first iteration, we plan to add features that allow parties to share information about their case. For example, "I sued Citibank over this and here are the relevant filings." Or, "this case is related to this court case." Or even further, for attorneys, "contact me if you're considering a similar case and I'll help you learn from our lessons."

We want the parties to an arbitration to be able to share their experience. It allows the general public to make more informed decisions. It also allows us to collect and analyze data on the parties themselves, including the arbitrators. e.g., does a particular arbitrator always side with the business? Does the arbitrator fail to comply with the law? What is the summary data telling us?

This database is the first step. We have formed Level Playing Field as a 501(c)(3) and hope to raise enough money to add as many cool and useful features as possible.

We want to help you. We want to level the playing field. At the end of the day, a more transparent process helps all parties make better decisions - not just consumers.
